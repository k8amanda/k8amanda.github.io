    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Kate Hanson. I was born and raised in Long Beach, New York. Currently I am
    a rising sophomore at Tufts University in Medford, MA. My major is Computer Science within the
    School of Engineering and my minor is Engineering Management. I am also the Social Chair for our
    school's Women in Computer Science (WiCS) organization.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Long Beach High School in 2017 with an Internation Baccalaureate degree. I was the president
      of our Literary Club and would lead the members in in-depth discussions about what we were reading as well as
      organizing book drives. I was the editor of our yearbook and took the majority of the pictures that were
      used. In addition, I introduced an annual student-faculty game titled "Basketball for EB" where we donated all
      proceeds to EB Research Partnership. This is a non-profit organization I have volunteered for since I was twelve.</p>
    <p> I enjoy going to the beach with my family and taking road trips with my friends. A few of my favorites include sitcoms,
      anything chocolate, giraffes, and the color blue. I love doing anything artistic including dancing, writing, drawing,
      and playing the flute. Someday I hope to follow a creative path within the field of Computer Science.</p>
