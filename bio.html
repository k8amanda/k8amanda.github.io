    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Kate Hanson. I was born and raised in Long Beach, New York. Currently I am
    a rising sophomore at Tufts University in Medford, MA. My major is Computer Science within the
    School of Engineering and my minor is Engineering Management. I am also the Social Chair for our
    school's Women in Computer Science (WiCS) organization.</p>
    <p> I enjoy going to the beach with my family and taking road trips with my friends!
      I love doing anything artistic including dancing, writing, drawing, and playing the flute.
      Someday I hope to follow a creative path within the field of Computer Science.</p>
